\indent I express my gratitude to Prof. Reddy, for his continuous guidance, support and motivation. He wants his students to achieve only the very best. I admire his enthusiasm about each and everything he does, including research and teaching. Also, I admire his humility and openness. I have learned immensely in last couple of years under his supervision and I wish to match him up in skills, knowledge, and dedication.  


I am also grateful to friends, colleagues, department faculty and staff for making my time at Texas A\&M University a great experience.

Finally, I thank to my parents, who have always shown confidence in me and supported me in my endeavors. Everything that I have achieved in life was not possible without their unconditional love and support.
