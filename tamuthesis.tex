  tabsize=2,                       % sets default tabsize to 2 spaces
  title=\lstname                   % show the filename of files included with \lstinputlisting; also try caption instead of title

% Hyperref setup below.  You should be able to get away with using uncommenting just the first line.
%\usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref}

% if \usepackage[hidelinks]{hyperref} doesn't work try this.
% \usepackage{hyperref}  % Hidelinks is an option that removes link visiability.  TAMU Thesis Offices prefers to not see the links. But often doesn't work.

%%%%%%%  End of hyperref setup.  One of these two options should work, but my motto with hyperref is when in doubt, comment it out!
%%%%%%%%%  This hopefully fixes the problem with vertical spacing of section headings at the top of the page..  Commented out in 1.0.7
